# Basic-Statistics
# Measures Of Central Tendency
Central Tendency is a descriptive summary of a dataset through a single value that reflects (center of) the dataset.It id s branch of Descriptive Statistics
# Mean
Mean is central value that is calulated by summing all the data valeus and dividing by the no of values.<br>
example
2,3,4,5,6
Mean = 20/5 = 4
### issue with mean
consider we have data 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 its mean is 20/10 = 2<br>
now consider we have a new data value 100 now the data is 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,100 its mean is 120/11=10.9
# Median
The middle value in a dataset that is arranged in ascending order (from the smallest value to the largest value)

2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 its median is 2
2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,100 median is also 2
# Mode
Defines the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. In some cases, a dataset may contain multiple modes while some datasets may not have any mode at all.
2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 its mode is 2<br>
2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,100 mode is also 2<br>
2,3,4,5,6 has no mode<br>
2,3,4,5,6,2,5 has two modes 2,5
# Measures of Dispersion
The mean of 2,2,3,3 is 2.5<br>
The mean of 5,0,0,5 is also 2.5<br>
as we can see for both data mean is sam, hence is not able to uniquely represent data alone, along with central tencdency we need to know about the dispersion of data
# Variance
Variance is the average of squared distance of the data values from mean
# Standard Deviation
square root of variance is standard deviation<br>
it is needed so that the unit of data and dispersion becomes same
